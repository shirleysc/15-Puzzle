# 15-Puzzle
My implementation of the 15-puzzle game, in Java.

(1) Run Puzzle15 to play the game

(2) Run Puzzle15Tests to run some tests

The 15-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. Game is represented by 4x4 tiles board where 15 numbered tiles are initially placed in random order and where 16th tile is missing. A tile can be moved to a neighbour empty place. To succeed in the game you need to order tiles from 1 to 15, where tile number 1 is at the top left corner and empty one is at the bottom right corner.
